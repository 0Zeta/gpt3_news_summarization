# GPT-3 News summarization by SML-2
an article summarization project for the 2021 TUM.ai GPT-3 Makeathon

## Description
This is a simple proof of concept prototype of our solution for the News summarization challenge set by [BR](https://www.br.de/index.html). Our web-app is able to generate short, easy to understand summaries for German news articles. Additionally, meaningful hashtags and small quizzes with different answers can be generated.

## Disclaimer
The underlying API (GPT-3 by OpenAI) sometimes produces misinformation and sensitive content, so human supervision is always required as neither we or OpenAI take responsibility for the content generated by this application. Also usage of our software isn't permitted for non-academic or commercial purposes.

## Getting Started
The web-app is based on the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework, which offers [easy deployment](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web), but we provide a live demonstration of the application [here](https://sml2.schnack.dev/#/).

Simply put the article you want to summarize in the left text field and click on the black "Summarize"-button. If you haven't entered your GPT-3 API key yet, please enter it in the prompt appearing on the screen and click "Summarize" again. A summary of the article in German and appealing hashtags should be displayed soon after that. Using the "Quiz"-button you can generate a question on the article with several answers.
